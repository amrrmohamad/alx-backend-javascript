## üßë‚Äçüíª Overview

This Node.js backend Intro serves as a server-side implementation for managing resources. It utilizes Express.js for routing and middleware, Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling, and includes features like authentication, validation, and logging. 

This project is designed to be easily extendable, allowing developers to build upon the foundation provided.

## ‚ú® Features

This repository includes various features for building and managing a Node.js backend:

- **RESTful API**: Implements RESTful API design principles for resource management.
- **Database Integration**: Uses MongoDB for data persistence with Mongoose as an ODM.
- **User Authentication**: Incorporates JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.
- **Input Validation**: Utilizes middleware for validating incoming requests.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling to manage application errors effectively.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses environment variables for configuration management with dotenv.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have:

- Node.js installed (version 14 or higher).
- MongoDB installed or a MongoDB Atlas account for cloud database hosting.
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and RESTful API concepts.

You can check if Node.js is installed by running:

```bash
node -v
```
